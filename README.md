# radial_interferogram_analysis
The rapid and accurate R algorithm based on radial image processing is designed to extract the phase within the central region of an interferogram featuring circular fringes acquired from a self-built Michelson-type interferometer with a single rough surface. 
The algorithm combined the results from ImageJ software to calculate surface roughness parameters based on the radial intensity distribution of the circular two-beam interference pattern.
